# Ray Tracing in one weekend series
This repository includes all the practice codes from the 3 ray tracing book written by Peter Shirley.

# Unsolved Bugs
1. Some problems with generating "The final scene" in the Next Week book. Two boxes area didn't show up in the rendering. Is there some bugs in the bvh_node part? 

# Questions
1. In Next Week book, when dealing with the translation and rotation, why should we update some info in the hit_record after invoking the hit method? Would invoke the hit method will automatically update the hit_record info like "normal" and "p"?

2. In the third book, confused about some equations, and how to understand the pdf for random directions intuitively?
